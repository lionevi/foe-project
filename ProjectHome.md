Users in Internet censored countries often find themselves unable to access foreign news websites or RSS feeds such as the ones from Voice of America, CNN, BBC, etc.

Until now, the only way users in censored countries can access these websites is to use a proxy server or install a proxy software on their computer.

FOE (Feed Over Email) is a new tool that allows users to receive RSS feeds from foreign websites without the need to find a working proxy server or install any proxy software.

Technically, FOE is built on top of SMTP and work on most email servers as long as the user has access to POP3 and SMTP.
